    <h3><u>Forecast Accuracy Items</u></h3>
    <p>
      Forecast Accuracy Items GSheet is a process implemented by the NSC RAN Planning team for the
      Forecast Accuracy Tableau Dashboard. Using this GSheet, the Demand Planners can customize the
      Forecast Months for which specific Common IDs should be reported on the Forecast Accuracy
      Tableau Dashboard.
      <br><br>

      There are two distinct values in the `Input` tab's Month columns,
      <br><br><b>1. <u>Exclude</u></b><br>
      These values have been preset by the logic using the `Planned Start Date` and `Planned End Date`
      columns, which are managed by the Tracked Items table process. These values <b>cannot be edited</b>
      via this GSheet. To edit these values, you will need to edit the Planning dates accordingly via
      the <b>Tracked Items process</b> managed by Terrence Belmonti.

      <br><br><b>2. <u>Manual Constraint</u></b><br>
      These values have been manually edited and managed by the Demand Planners for their respective
      items via this GSheet. To edit these values, you can utilize the following two scripts available
      under the <b>Editor menu</b>,

      <ol type="a">
        <li><b><u>Add Constraint Items</u></b><br>
          Use this option to add the `Manual Constraint` values to the specific Common IDs and Months. You can
          add single or multiple items and months. You can only add constraint items to current and future months.
          <br><br>
        </li>
        <li><b><u>Remove Constraint Items</u></b><br>
          Use this option to remove any `Manual Constraint` values. You can only remove the values that have
          been set earlier using the `Add Constraint Item` script. You can remove single or multiple items and
          months with this option. You can only remove constraint items from current and future months.
        </li>
      </ol>
